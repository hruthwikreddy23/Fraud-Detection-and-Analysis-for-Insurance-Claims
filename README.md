# Fraud Detection and Analysis for Insurance Claims

This repository contains the Jupyter Notebook and plots used for the project **"Fraud Detection and Analysis for Insurance Claims"**. The project applies two deep learning approaches to a public auto insurance dataset:

- **Artificial Neural Network (ANN)** – supervised fraud classification  
- **Autoencoder** – unsupervised anomaly detection based on reconstruction error  

The goal is to build a clear workflow for preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization.

## Contents
- `fraud_detection_insurance.ipynb`  
  Main notebook containing all steps: data preprocessing, ANN model, autoencoder model, evaluation metrics, and visualizations.
  
- `plots/`  
  Folder containing all figures used in the report (confusion matrices, ROC curves, loss curves, reconstruction error plots, etc.).

## Project
This code corresponds to the experiments and analysis presented in the course project report.
