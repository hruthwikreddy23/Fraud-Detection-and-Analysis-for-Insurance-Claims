# Fraud Detection and Analysis for Insurance Claims 
This project implements two deep learning approaches for detecting auto insurance claim fraud using structured tabular data:

- **Supervised Artificial Neural Network (ANN) classifier**
- **Unsupervised autoencoder anomaly detector**

The goal is to build a clear and reproducible workflow for fraud detection, including data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization.
