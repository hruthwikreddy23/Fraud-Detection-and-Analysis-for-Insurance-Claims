# Deep Learning for Auto Insurance Fraud Detection

This project implements two deep learning approaches for detecting auto insurance claim fraud using structured tabular data:

- **Supervised Artificial Neural Network (ANN) classifier**
- **Unsupervised autoencoder anomaly detector**

The goal is to build a clear and reproducible workflow for fraud detection, including data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization.

## Files

- `deep_learning_fraud_detection.ipynb` – Main Jupyter Notebook with all experiments (data loading, preprocessing, ANN, autoencoder, metrics, and plots).
- `requirements.txt` – Python dependencies needed to run the notebook.
- `figures/` – (Optional) Folder for exported plots used in the report.
- `paper/` – (Optional) LaTeX report following the NeurIPS 2023 template.
